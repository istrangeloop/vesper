// this will be the logic for the
// spaced repetition cards feature! âœ¨

// we will need to:
// read a file with questions and answers
// display teh question. show a prompt and then the
// recorded right answer

// we will choose between questions based on freshness,
// so we will need to keep track of that too.

// the program will mark the freshness score and date of last
// repetition to decide which needs to be displayed today

// oh wait what if user-chan did not use the program in a while?

// we need smarter indexes, based on usage.

// we can store which time it is in a variable, and
// always update according to fibonacci or other sequence.
// so if its day 7 of the card, the next time it will show up will
// be on day TODAY + 13
// our wittwe card structure
// questin
// answer
// topic
// got wrong?
// next appearance

// if got_wrong is set, it will show up when user is studying the topic
