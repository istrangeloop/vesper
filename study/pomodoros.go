// this one will be our pomodoro session assistant!

// we need a timer. When setting it, user will choose how many and
// the intervals: 30 / 5, 25/5, 40/10, whichever works best for her.

// timer will run and display a cute hourglass.

// when timer is up, a sound will play (can cli do this?) or a
// message will blink.

// you can mark sessions as "fruitful" or "unfruitful"
// so if you did little today you will do it again sooner.
// if you did a lot you will focus on other tasks.
